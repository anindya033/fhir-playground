# FHIR Playground
This repository contains my personal FHIR-related learning projects, built using Spring Boot, Angular, and the HAPI FHIR library. Each folder is a standalone demo focused on understanding different FHIR components and workflows.

This repository is my personal learning space for exploring FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources), Spring Boot, Angular, and SMART-on-FHIR integrations.
